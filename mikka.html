			<h2><b><i>Mikka Azores</i></b></h2>
		<br>
		<h4>
			Mikka Azores is a 21-year old (turning 22 soon) who just moved to London, ON from Metro Manila - a bigger city in the Philippines.

		<br>
			She has lived there all her life and is now currently loving snow (surprisingly) except for when it's a slushie,

		<br>
			and missing her girlfriend, friends, family and dogs, the busy and vibrant city, driving everywhere, 

		<br>
			and ending her day in her favorite place in the world - her bedroom.

		<br><br>
			After getting a degree in Multimedia Arts from the pioneer of MMA in the Philippines, 

		<br>she became a Multimedia Arts consultant for Maybelline Philippines, 

		<br>
			where she designed and created collaterals for the brand 

		<br>
			ranging from social media posts/ads, store visuals, and all the way up to LED billboards.

		<br><br>
			She's very proud of that. 

		<br><br>
			Another thing she's proud of, among other things, are:
		
		<br>
			coming out in 2017 to her parents as bi, living a life she likes,
		
		<br>
			and hiking one of the hardest mountains in the Philippines.

			I learned that Ife had work experience as an intern and that
			<br>that was the pathway that led her to Fanshawe.
		
		<br>
			I also didn't know that she had dogs.

		<br>
			She's younger than me and I'm amazed at her bravery to move
		
		<br>
			all the way to Canada alone.
